I love this idea. NTA OP - you have your daughters back and totally get her need for privacy and autonomy over her stuff. I’m disgusted that her own mother isn’t more supportive. Please lend some mothers makeup to the twins, because obviously it’s what girls do, isn’t it? They love to borrow and use each other’s stuff. Without asking. Not.
